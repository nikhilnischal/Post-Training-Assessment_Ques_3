You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. 
You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. 
But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. 
Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.


--->
#### Assuming namespace as default in this case
1. Check the specific replica-set is up and running. (kubectl get rs )
2. Check the service exposed for the pod (kubectl get svc and then kubectl describe svc <service-name> and look after the TargetPort assigned to 8000 or not.
3. Check the NodePort - must be in range of 32000 to 32767
4. If these are not working, we can try port forwarding (kubectl port-forward svc <svc-name> 80:8080
5. Still having issue, will refer the kubernetes documentation section
